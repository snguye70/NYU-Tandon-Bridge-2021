// HW4_Q4.cpp : This file contains the 'main' function. Program execution begins and ends there.
// Write two versions of a program that reads a sequence of positive integers from the user, calculates their geometric mean, and print the geometric mean.
// a) First read the length of the sequence.
// b) Keep reading the numbers until -1 is entered.
