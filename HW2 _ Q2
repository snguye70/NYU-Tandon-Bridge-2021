// HW2_Q2.cpp : This file contains the 'main' function. Program execution begins and ends there.

// QUESTION 2:
// Write	a	program	that	asks the	user	to	enter	an	amount	of	money	in	the	format	of	dollars	and	
// remaining	cents.The	program	should	calculateand print	the	minimum	number	of	coins
// (quarters, dimes, nickelsand pennies)	that	are	equivalent	to	the	given	amount.

// Hint:	In	order	to	find	the	minimum	number	of	coins, first	find	the	maximum	number	of
// quarters	that	fit	in	the	given	amount	of	money, then	find	the	maximum	number	of	dimes that	fit	in	the	remaining	amount, and so	on
