// HW3_Q6.cpp : This file contains the 'main' function. Program execution begins and ends there.
// Write	a	program	that	computes	the	cost	of	a	long-distance	call.	The	cost	of	 the	call	is	
// determined	according	to	the	following	rate	schedule :
// • Any	call	started	between	8 : 00	A.M. and 6 : 00	P.M., Monday	through	Friday, is	billed	at	a
// rate	of	$0.40	per	minute.
// • Any	call	starting	before	8 : 00	A.M. or after	6 : 00	P.M., Monday	through	Friday, is	charged
// at	a	rate	of	$0.25	per	minute.
// • Any	call	started	on	a	Saturday or Sunday	is	charged	at	a	rate	of	$0.15	per	minute.
// The	input	will	consist	of	the	day	of	the	week, the	time	the	call	started, and the	length	of	the
// call	in	minutes.
// The	output	will	be	the	cost	of	the	call.
// Notes :
//    1. The	time	is	to	be	input	in	24 - hour	notation, so	the	time	1 : 30	P.M.is	input	as	 13 : 30
//    2. The	day	of	the	week	will	be	read	as	one	of	the	following	two	character	string : Mo		Tu
//    We		Th		Fr		Sa		Su
//    3. The	number	of	minutes	will	be	input	as	a	positive	integer
