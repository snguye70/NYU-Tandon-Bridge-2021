// HW3_Q6// HW3_Q6.cpp : This file contains the 'main' function. Program execution begins and ends there.
// Write a program that	computes the cost of a long-distance call. The cost of  the call is determined according to the	following rate schedule:
// • Any call started	between	8:00 A.M. and 6:00 P.M., Monday through Friday, is billed at a rate of	$0.40 per minute.
// • Any call starting	before	8:00 A.M. or after 6:00 P.M., Monday through Friday, is	charged at a rate of $0.25 per minute.
// • Any call started on a Saturday or Sunday is charged at a rate of $0.15 per	minute.
// The	input	will consist of	the day	of the week, the time the call started, and the	length of the call in minutes.
// The	output will be	the cost of the call.
// Notes:
//    1. The time is to	be input in 24 - hour notation, so the	time 1 : 30 P.M.is input as 13 : 30
//    2. The day of the	week will be read as one of the	following two character	string : Mo,Tu, We, Th, Fr, Sa, Su
//    3. The number of	minutes	will be	input as a positive integer
