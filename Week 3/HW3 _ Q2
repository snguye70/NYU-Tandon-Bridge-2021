// HW3_Q2.cpp : This file contains the 'main' function. Program execution begins and ends there.
// Write a program that:
// • Asks the user for their name.
// • Asks the user to input	their graduation year.
// • Asks the user to input	the	current	year.
// Assume the student is in	a four - year undergraduate	program.Display	the	current	status the student is in.
// Possible	status include: not in college yet, freshman, sophomore, junior, senior, graduated.
// Note: If graduation year equals to	current	year, status is	‘Graduated’; 
// if graduation year is four years	after current	year, status is	‘Freshman’, etc
