// HW2_Q3.cpp : This file contains the 'main' function. Program execution begins and ends there.

// QUESTION 3: 
// Suppose	John	and	Bill	worked for	some	time	and	we	want	to	calculate	the	total	time	both	of	
// them	worked.Write	a	program	that	reads	number	of	days, hours, minutes	each	of	them
// worked, and prints	the	total	time	both	of	them	worked	together	as	days, hours, minutes.

// Hint: Try	to	adapt	the	elementary	method	for	addition	of	numbers	to	this	use.
